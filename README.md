Hey, this is my public table with the dangerous/cheat options removed for the sake of the game

What it contains: *note that streamer mode is clientside*
  1. Camera Saturation Modifier
  2. Removal of AFK kicks
  3. Removal of the emote cooldown
  4. Third Person animations in first person
  5. Streamer Mode (fake name, playfab, rank display type, change level, fake ping, and add moderator badge)
